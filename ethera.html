          <p>Founded in 2022, Cinetic Motion started their journey in innovating the use of robotics in video production and they came to me for assistance with design and strategy. While this is not the first of its kind, tech such as this was only used in the prosumer sector, they wanted to explore new ways to make the technology more user-friendly. Specifically for consumers.
            <br><br>
            While the engineers were busy figuring out the movements necessary to a video producer, I was working closely with the CEO in exploring opportunities to enhance the user experience and improve usability. I also took this opportunity to challenge limits of their existing visual aesthetic.
