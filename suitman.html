            <H2>The Challenge & Approach</H2>
            <p>Initially overwhelmed with a large volume of images, I found inspiration in Suitman's public artworks. Following his method, I decided to showcase them similarly, creating a wall of images on a single page. This design choice effectively showed the immense scale of his project.

            <H2>The Challenge</H2>
            <p>Kim Jung Man is a traditional photographer and did not like the idea of having a website. However, there was a demand as he was going to be showing at a major event in Paris. If anyone requested information about his works he would send off a pdf.

            <H2>Approach</H2>
            <p>
              I decided to approach this in a very simple manner. I created a website that resembled a pdf reader and a site which would allow him to just show what he would normally send in his PDFs. He was satisfied with the simplicity of the website and also gave him an online presence.
