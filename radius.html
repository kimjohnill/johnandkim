                <H1>Background</H1>
                <p>Founded in 2022, Cinetic Motion started their journey in innovating the use of robotics in video production and they came to me for assistance with design and strategy. While this is not the first of its kind, tech such as this was only used in the prosumer sector, they wanted to explore new ways to make the technology more user-friendly. Specifically for consumers.
                  <br><br>
                  While the engineers were busy figuring out the movements necessary to a video producer, I was working closely with the CEO in exploring opportunities to enhance the user experience and improve usability. I also took this opportunity to challenge limits of their existing visual aesthetic.

              <H1>Approach</H1>
              <p>To succeed on the project, we connected with a commercial production company to explore design concepts and use cases. Also, we were able to explore the necessities of the camera operator and come up with ways to simplify tasks in comparison to rivaling products.</p>

                <H1>The Challenge</H1>
                <p>As features on the product were mounting, it was progressively becoming more complex for the average videographer to comprehend. We explored ways to simplify the product by conducting interviews with various video producers working in other sectors.</p>
