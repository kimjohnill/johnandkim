                <H2>Background</H2>
                <p>Founded in 2022, Cinetic Motion set out to redefine the use of robotics in video production. Seeking my assistance with design and strategy, they aimed to stand out in an area where similar technology had mostly been limited to the prosumer sector. Their unique vision involved making this advanced tech more accessible and user-friendly, with a particular focus on reaching consumers.
                  <br><br>
                  While the engineers were busy in their work with the robotics, dealing with technical details, I collaborated closely with the CEO to explore opportunities for enhancing user experience and usability. Additionally, I took this chance to challenge the limits of their existing visual aesthetic.

            <H2>Approach & The Challenge</H2>
            <p>To succeed on the project, we connected with a commercial production company to explore design concepts and use cases. We were able to explore the necessities of cinematographers and come up with ways to simplify tasks in comparison to rivaling products.
            <br>
              <br>
              As features on the product continued to grow, it became progressively more challenging for the average videographer to navigate the application. To enhance usability, we worked on simplifying the product through interviews with video producers from different sectors.
